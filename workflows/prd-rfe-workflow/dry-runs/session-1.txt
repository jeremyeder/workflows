I'm ready to help you with product discovery! However, I notice that no initial problem or product idea was provided after the /prd.discover command.

To get started with the discovery process, I need to understand what product or feature you'd like to explore.

Please provide:

A brief description of the problem you're trying to solve, or
The product/feature idea you want to develop
For example:

"A mobile app to help freelancers track their time and invoices"
"A feature that allows users to collaborate on documents in real-time"
"A platform to connect local farmers with consumers"
Once you share your initial idea, I'll:

Create a comprehensive discovery document
Conduct research and analysis on the problem space
Ask clarifying questions to fill in any gaps
Provide insights and recommendations for next steps
What product or feature would you like to explore?

12:09:27
I want to create a 'canvas' for Ambient Code platform that enables users to edit text documents alongside the chat window.

Discovery Complete!
I've created a comprehensive discovery document at artifacts/discovery.md analyzing the Ambient Code canvas feature.

Key Insights
The Opportunity
Users are experiencing context-switching friction when working with AI on documents. Current solutions either focus on viewing AI outputs (Claude Artifacts) or separate the editing experience (ChatGPT Canvas). There's an opportunity for Ambient Code to provide a more integrated collaborative editing experience.

Target Users
Primary: Software developers using Ambient Code for code and documentation
Secondary: Technical writers, product managers, data scientists
Main User Pain Points
Constant context switching between chat and external editors
Difficulty reviewing AI changes in text format
Loss of flow state during editing iterations
No real-time visual feedback on document evolution
Competitive Position
You can differentiate by offering the best of both worlds: conversational AI interaction + rich document editing, specifically tailored for developer workflows.

Critical Questions I Need Your Input On
Before moving to requirements, please help me understand:

Canvas Activation: Should the canvas open automatically when AI discusses document edits, or only when users explicitly request it?

File Type Priority: Should we start with markdown/plain text only, or include code files with syntax highlighting from day one?

Edit Conflict Handling: If a user is typing and AI suggests changes to the same section simultaneously, how should we handle this? (Queue changes? Show preview? Lock sections?)

Integration with Existing Workflow: How does Ambient Code currently handle file editing? Will canvas replace or complement existing functionality?

MVP Scope: What's more important for v1: basic editing with great AI integration, or broader file format support?

Recommended Next Step
Once you've provided input on these questions, run /prd.requirements to gather detailed requirements and define the feature specifications.

What are your thoughts on these questions?

12:18:15
Canvas Activation: Should the canvas open automatically when AI discusses document edits, or only when users explicitly request it?
Only when the users explicitly request it.

File Type Priority: Should we start with markdown/plain text only, or include code files with syntax highlighting from day one?
Markdown and plain text only. Code can come later.

Edit Conflict Handling: If a user is typing and AI suggests changes to the same section simultaneously, how should we handle this? (Queue changes? Show preview? Lock sections?) Lock the file while AI is making changes. If the user tries to edit the file while AI is editing it, then ask them if they want to queue the change?

Integration with Existing Workflow: How does Ambient Code currently handle file editing? Will canvas replace or complement existing functionality?

There is no integrated file editing. All file edits are made out of band and stored in a GitHub repo that is then in tern associated with the session.

MVP Scope: What's more important for v1: basic editing with great AI integration, or broader file format support?
Basic editing. No question.

Discovery Updated Successfully ✅
Document: artifacts/discovery.md

Key Decisions Captured
Canvas Activation: User-controlled only (explicit request)

Provides predictable UX, no surprises
Edit Conflict Handling: File locking with queue prompts

AI locks file during edits
User prompted to queue changes if they try to edit simultaneously
File Type Support: Markdown and plain text only for MVP

Code files deferred to future releases
Integration: Canvas is the FIRST integrated editing experience

Current workflow uses out-of-band GitHub repo
Canvas will sync back to GitHub (details TBD)
MVP Priority: Basic editing with great AI integration

Quality over feature breadth
Remaining Questions to Address
These will be tackled during requirements gathering:

Canvas state management approach (client vs. server-synced)
GitHub sync strategy (auto-save vs. manual, commit approach)
Access control (all users vs. premium tier)
Offline scenario handling
Undo/redo strategy
Ready for Next Phase
Your discovery is complete and ready to move into detailed requirements gathering. When you're ready, run:

Requirements Gathering Complete! ✅
I've created a comprehensive requirements document at artifacts/requirements.md

What's Been Defined
Business Requirements
6 Business Goals including reducing context switching, competitive differentiation, and increasing engagement
6 Success Criteria with measurable targets (60% adoption, 70% retention, 35% efficiency gain)
7 Constraints covering technical, performance, timeline, and compatibility requirements
User Requirements
8 Detailed User Stories covering:

Opening existing documents
Creating new documents
Manual editing
AI-driven editing
Edit conflict management
Saving changes
Reviewing AI changes
Navigating between chat and canvas
3 Complete User Flows demonstrating end-to-end scenarios

Functional Requirements
13 Functional Requirements prioritized as:
8 Must-Have (P0) - Core MVP features
3 Should-Have (P1) - Post-MVP enhancements
2 Could-Have (P2) - Future nice-to-haves
Key MVP features include:

Dual-pane canvas interface
File operations (open/create/save)
Text editing with undo/redo
AI-driven editing with locking
Visual diff highlighting
GitHub synchronization
Non-Functional Requirements
Comprehensive specifications for:

Performance (500ms load time, 60fps editing)
Security (data integrity, access control, audit trails)
Scalability (10,000+ concurrent users)
Accessibility (keyboard nav, screen readers, WCAG AA)
Reliability (99.9% uptime, data loss prevention)
Scope Definition
11 items explicitly out of scope for MVP
9 future features documented for post-MVP consideration
Critical Open Issues
Three key issues need resolution before development:

GitHub Sync Strategy: How do canvas saves integrate with GitHub commits? Auto-commit vs. manual?

State Management: Client-side only or server-synced? Session recovery strategy?

Access Control: Available to all users or premium tier? Phased rollout?

Questions for You
To finalize the requirements, I need your input on these decisions:

1. GitHub Commit Strategy
How should canvas saves work with GitHub?

Option A: Auto-commit on every save with auto-generated commit messages
Option B: Manual commit flow where user saves to canvas, then explicitly commits to GitHub
Option C: Batch commits (e.g., all canvas saves in a session = 1 commit at session end)
2. State Management
Where should canvas state live?

Option A: Client-side only (localStorage) - simpler, but lost on browser clear
Option B: Server-synced - more robust, enables session recovery, but more complex
3. User Access
Who gets the canvas feature?

Option A: All users (free feature) - maximize adoption and competitive positioning
Option B: Premium users only - monetization opportunity
Option C: Phased rollout (beta users first, then general availability)
4. Auto-Save Timing
How frequently should auto-save trigger?

Suggested: 30 seconds of inactivity
Should this be user-configurable?
Next Steps
Once you answer these questions, we can:

Update the requirements document with final decisions
Run /prd.create to create the comprehensive PRD
Move into RFE breakdown and prioritization
What are your decisions on the open issues above?

Requirements Document Updated Successfully! ✅
Document: artifacts/requirements.md

All Critical Decisions Finalized
I've updated the requirements document with all your architectural decisions:

1. GitHub Sync Strategy ✅
Batch commits at session end
During session: Saves go to workspace file system only
Single commit when session closes with auto-generated message
Example commit message: "Canvas edits: Updated README.md, project-plan.md"
2. State Management ✅
Client-side localStorage only
Canvas state (content, cursor, undo stack) stored in browser
Session recovery attempts to restore from localStorage
Simpler architecture, faster MVP delivery
3. Auto-Save ✅
30 seconds of inactivity (fixed, not configurable)
Saves to workspace file system (not GitHub immediately)
Visual "Saving..." / "Saved" indicators
4. User Access ✅
Free for all users
General availability at launch
No premium tier restriction
Maximizes adoption and competitive positioning
Updated Sections
✅ FR-7 (Save & Persistence): Now reflects batch commit strategy

Risk assessment & mitigation
Definition of done checklist
Next Steps
Immediate Action
Run /rfe.prioritize to:

Create prioritized implementation roadmap
Apply prioritization frameworks (RICE, MoSCoW, Value vs. Effort)
Generate sprint plan
Identify quick wins and blockers
Create Gantt chart or timeline
After Prioritization
Technical Design (Week 1-2)

Detailed technical specs for RFE-001, RFE-002, RFE-003
Select text editor component (Monaco vs. CodeMirror)
Define AI edit protocol
Sprint Planning (Week 2)

Break RFEs into 2-week sprint tasks
Assign to engineers
Set up tracking (Jira, GitHub issues, etc.)
Begin Implementation (Week 3+)

Start Phase 1: Foundation
RFE-001 → RFE-002 → RFE-003
RFE Breakdown Highlights
Well-Scoped RFEs
Each RFE is:

Atomic: Independently deliverable
Sized Appropriately: 1-15 days (none too large or too small)
Testable: Clear acceptance criteria
Traceable: Links back to PRD requirements
Sequenced: Dependencies identified
Valuable: Each delivers user/business value
Critical Path Identified
Longest dependency chain: RFE-001 → RFE-003 → RFE-005 → RFE-006

This is your critical path - delays here impact overall timeline.

MVP vs. Post-MVP Clear
11 MVP RFEs (P0) - Must ship for launch
4 Post-MVP RFEs (P1/P2) - Ship after launch
Recommendation: Focus team on MVP RFEs; defer Post-MVP to Phase 4.

Ready for prioritization! Run /rfe.prioritize when ready to create your implementation roadmap.

The individual RFE files are stored in:

Directory:
/workspace/sessions/agentic-session-1766077281/workspace/artifacts/rfe-tasks/

Currently created:

RFE-001-dual-pane-canvas-layout.md - Detailed specification for the foundational dual-pane layout
Remaining RFEs to create (if needed):

RFE-002-file-operations.md
RFE-003-text-editor-integration.md
RFE-004-undo-redo-find-replace.md
RFE-005-ai-driven-editing.md
RFE-006-edit-locking.md
RFE-007-visual-diff-highlighting.md
RFE-008-save-persistence.md
RFE-009-auto-save.md
RFE-010-github-commit.md
RFE-011-canvas-activation.md
RFE-012-multi-file-switching.md (Post-MVP)
RFE-013-markdown-preview.md (Post-MVP)
RFE-014-change-history.md (Post-MVP)
RFE-015-document-templates.md (Post-MVP)
I created RFE-001 as a sample to demonstrate the format. The master list in artifacts/rfes.md contains detailed descriptions of all 15 RFEs, which can serve as the source for creating the remaining individual files if needed.

Would you like me to:

Create all remaining individual RFE task files (RFE-002 through RFE-015)?
Create only the MVP RFEs (RFE-002 through RFE-011)?
Proceed to /rfe.prioritize with the current master list?
The master list (rfes.md) already contains all the essential information, so individual files are optional - they're most useful for:

Task tracking in project management tools
Assigning specific RFEs to engineers
Detailed implementation planning per RFE
