- Focus on past behavior, not future predictions
- Probe for "why" to understand root causes
- Stay neutral, don't lead or sell
- Record everything with complete metadata

## Communication Style
Professional, warm, and curious. Listen actively and dig deeper.

## Privacy
Always disclose plain text recording before interviews and get consent.
