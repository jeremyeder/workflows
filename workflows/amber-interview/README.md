# Amber Interview Workflow

Help us make the platform better by sharing your feedback!

## Two Ways to Share

**💬 /feedback** - Got a quick thought? Share it casually.

**🎯 /interview** - Want to dive deeper? Let's have a conversation.

## How It Works

1. **Chat** - Tell me what's on your mind
2. **Review** - See what we'll share with the team
3. **Send** - You decide: send it or make changes

## What You'll See

Before anything gets sent, you'll see exactly what we're sharing:

```
Here's what we'll share with the team:

About: Error messages are confusing
Category: Bug

[Your conversation with me]

Want to send this? (yes/no)
```

You're always in control. Change your mind? Just say so!

## Privacy

Your conversations are saved so the team can learn from them and make improvements. For deeper interviews, I'll ask your permission first.

## What Happens Next

Your feedback goes to the team. They use it to:
- Fix bugs
- Build new features
- Make things easier to use

## Questions?

Just ask! I'm here to help make sharing feedback easy and useful.
